Information about this analysis:

                 Dataframe: item_scores
                     Items: all
              Observations: 50
     Positive correlations: 46 out of 66 (70%)

Estimates assuming interval level:

             Omega (total): 0.778
      Omega (hierarchical): 0.605
   Revelle's omega (total): 0.778
Greatest Lower Bound (GLB): 0.83
             Coefficient H: 0.976
         Coefficient alpha: 0.682

(Estimates assuming ordinal level not computed, as the polychoric correlation matrix has missing values.)

Note: the normal point estimate and confidence interval for omega are based on the procedure suggested by Dunn, Baguley & Brunsden (2013) using the MBESS function ci.reliability, whereas the psych package point estimate was suggested in Revelle & Zinbarg (2008). See the help ('?scaleStructure') for more information.
